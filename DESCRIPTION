Description: The main goal of this package is to provide a set of
        functions for 1) the stratum lengths analysis along a chosen
        direction, 2) fast estimation of continuous lag spatial Markov
        chains model parameters and probability computing (also for
        large data sets), 3) transition probability maps and
        transiograms drawing, 4) simulation methods for categorical
        random fields.
