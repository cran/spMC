Description: The main goal of this package is to provide a set of functions for 1) the stratum lengths analysis along a chosen direction, 2) fast estimation of continuous lag spatial Markov chains model parameters and probability computing (also for large data sets), 3) transition probability maps and transiograms drawing, 4) simulation methods for categorical random fields.
