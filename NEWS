CHANGES IN spMC 0.3.1

  NEW FEATURES:
    o tpfit_ml(), tpfit_ils(), tpfit_me(), multi_tpfit_ml(), 
      multi_tpfit_ils(), multi_tpfit_me() and other functions are
      introduced for R-methods consistency (see list of deprecated
      and defunct functions).

    o multi_tpfit() and tpfit() may perform all the other estimation
      methods by the use of the new argument method.

    o sim() may simulate and predict with all the available methods.

  UTILITIES:
    o contour.pemt() display contours of the pseudo-empirical 
      multidimensional and superpose the contour lines of the 
      theoretical transition probabilities.

    o image.pemt() plot the pseudo-empirical multidimensional 
      transiograms, which where previously computed.

    o is.pemt() tests an object if it is of the class 'pemt'.

    o pemt() returns pseudo-empirical multidimensional transiograms.

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:
    o ck.sim() is defunct. Use sim_ck() instead.

    o embed.MC() is defunct. Use embed_MC() instead.

    o ik.sim() is defunct. Use sim_ik() instead.

    o ilstpfit() and multi.ilstpfit() are defunct. 

      Iterated least squares are available by the use of the functions
      tpfit_ils() or multi_tpfit_ils().

    o image.multi.tpfit() is defunct. Use image.multi_tpfit() instead.

    o imgMultiTransiogram() is defunct.

      Pseudo-empirical multidimensional transiograms are now computed 
      first by the function pemt() and then plotted through 
      image.pemt().

    o is.multi.tpfit() is defunct. Use is.multi_tpfit() instead.

    o is.multi.transiogram() is defunct. Use is.multi_transiogram()
      instead.

    o mcs.sim() is defunct. Use sim_mcs() instead.

    o metpfit and multi.metpfit() are defunct.

      Maximum entropy methods is available by the use of the functions
      tpfit_me() or multi_tpfit_me().

    o multi.tpfit() is defunct.

      Multidimensional version of tpfit() is available by the use of
      the function multi_tpfit().

    o path.sim() is defunct. Use sim_path() instead.

    o predict.multi.tpfit() is defunct. Use predict.multi_tpfit()
      instead.

    o print.multi.tpfit() is defunct. Use print.multi_tpfit() instead.

    o print.multi.transiogram() is defunct. Use 
      print.multi_transiogram() instead.

    o which.lines() is defunct. Use which_lines().
